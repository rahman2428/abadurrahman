My room is not a separate room because I live in a hostel, so three people live with me.\n\nEveryone uses the things kept in the room. My room is cleaned every week, so it stays neat and tidy. Even though I don’t really like my room, it is an important place in my college life.\n\nIn my room, I sleep, read, eat, and sometimes play games. My room makes me feel safe and confident."
